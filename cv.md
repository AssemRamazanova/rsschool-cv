## About me

I am at the very beginning of my frontend developer journey, but also have 13+ years of experience in legal/compliance. I believe that my background helps my a lot in becoming a professional developer. It's not obvious at the first sight, but there is a lot in common in these professions - analytical thinking, need to comprehend and structure big volumes of info, understand the terms, find most suitable solutions and many others.

The most exciting part about frontend development for me is when I see lines of code transforming into a webpage or application. It feels like magic and it's very important for me to be able to see visual representation of the work. Another important thing for me is that it provides lots of opportunities for professional growth and development and allows for more freedom in terms of working remote.
